# credit-card-checker

### A program that checks the type and validity of a credit card using Luhn's algorithm.

##  About this program

Credit cards are often used to pay for goods and services. Identification of credit card is represented in the numbers on it. These numbers help to know who to bill for each purchase made. There are a lot of people with credit cards, so the nummbers are pretty long. To solve the problem of identification and fake numbers, each vredit card has a structure to them. that is the check sum built into them.

The Luhn's Algorithm helps to check if a credit card is valid. This algorithm was invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM,

This project uses the Luhn's algorithm to validate credit card numbers by returning their type when valid and INVALID when it is not.
